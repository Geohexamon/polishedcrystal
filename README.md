# Pokémon Polished Crystal

This is a custom Pokémon game based on [the Pokémon Crystal disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal).

My goal is to create what the title says: an improved, polished version of Pokémon Crystal. It fixes bugs, takes into account the official game changes since 2001, and adds some new ideas of my own. Many features restore what was removed from R/B/Y, or original to HG/SS.

I've had vague plans to make a Pokémon game for years. I'm very impressed by the effort that's gone into disassembling Pokémon Crystal and making the code so well-organized. Thanks to making it open-source (and to the ROM hackers that inspired me), I'm finally making this game a reality.

## Download and Play

The most recent version is 1.1.2 as of August 2, 2016.

To play, download the .ips patch file, and use a tool like [Lunar IPS](http://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/) (for Windows), [MultiPatch](http://projects.sappharad.com/tools/multipatch.html) (for OS X), or [UniPatcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.emunix.unipatcher&hl=en) (for Android) to apply the patch to a default Crystal ROM.

This is the ROM you should use:

* Pokémon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.0) [C][!].gbc  
  (`md5: 9f2922b235a5eeb78d65594e82ef5dde`)

It's identical to the one built by the [pokecrystal](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal) project.

There are two patches for Polished Crystal. The "faithful" patch does not change any Pokémon base stats or move attributes beyond the updates in Gen VI. The regular patch has some custom changes for more diverse and viable Pokémon.

## Bugs

* The Move Reminder doesn't list all the possible moves.
* Sitrus Berry heals 25% max HP when used, but 30 HP when held.
* Thief permanently steals held items.
* TMs can restore PP.
* Avalanche's power doesn't double.

## FAQ

**Is there a Pokédex document I can refer to?**

The game's data files do a fairly good job of listing things you'll want to know.

* [Base stats and TM learnsets](data/base_stats/)
* [Level-up learnsets and evolution methods](data/evos_attacks.asm)
* [Egg moves](data/egg_moves.asm)
* [Move attributes](battle/moves/moves.asm)
* [TM+HM+tutor list](engine/tmhm.asm) (scroll to the bottom)
* [Wild Pokémon](data/wild/)

**How do I evolve Leafeon? Glaceon? Sylveon? Magnezone?**

* Eevee evolves into Leafeon in Ilex Forest, site of the Moss Rock.
* Eevee evolves into Glaceon in the Ice Path, site of the Ice Rock.
* Eevee evolves into Sylveon with a Shiny Stone.
* Magneton evolves into Magnezone in Rock Tunnel, site of the Lodestone.

**Where do I get the legendary Pokémon?**

* Articuno is in the Seafoam Islands.
* Zapdos is above the Power Plant after you fix the generator.
* Moltres is inside Cinnabar Volcano.
* Raikou and Entei are roaming Johto.
* Suicune is in the Bell Tower after you get the Clear Bell.
* Lugia is in the Whirl Islands after you catch all three legendary birds and get the Silver Wing. You'll receive the Silver Wing by triggering a certain event in Victory Road.
* Ho-Oh is atop the Bell Tower after you catch all three legendary beasts and get the Rainbow Wing. You'll receive the Rainbow Wing in the Bell Tower.
* Mewtwo is in Cerulean Cave.
* Mew and Celebi are a secret!

**I don't like non-canon Pokémon types!**

I was hesitant to make original changes like this, because the goal is to be an improved Crystal version, not a new game. In the end I made two versions, one regular (with changes) and one "faithful" (with original typings).
